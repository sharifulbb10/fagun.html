						<h2>What Do I Love?</h2>
						I love to play with hammer, magnet, nail, fire-matches, electric motors etc. Can you guess my passion? I love to be an Engineer (without degree, because right now I am in class 7 only!) I still did not decide my goal what may I become in future. It has a lot of time to decide. Now I am busy with breaking new toys & small electric or household things. My mother becomes angry with me somethimes for that. But I want to explore the inside of everything. Who will make her understand! </div>
